        be happy and 
        be healthy. 
        he smokes too. 
        and weve got angles on our side. 
        
        cheerio!
        theres a warm feeling inside 
        to show others the magic of nature 
        for himself
        

        daydreaming
        meticulous work
        birthing the trail
        curse civilization 
        
        he is me
        i am him

        <i>atlas</i> 
        
        dreams and reality carry heavy weights     
        that we carry with us with due diligence
        just like Atlas before us
        condemned for the fiery battles we fight
    
        out in the ether and tether reaches out to me
        an umbilical cord of divine energy surging under my skin
        sparking fast and wild like heat lighting during the dawn of the dog days
        a cool warm voice whispers calmly to me
    
        you're as strong as you standing feet
        and as devoted as your kneeling knees
        allow me to soften that load you carry on your feeble back
        so that you may move with natural embrace into the bright naked moonlight
    
        as that voice fades i'm enveloped by the light
        feeling only bliss and knowing only whats asked
        i'll see that red sun rise, warming the holy land in my heart
        and i'll see it set that evening, falling back into myself
    
        wherever i go and whatever i do
        i'll be guided by the moon and by the voice
        to see the holy sun rise and holy sun set

        <i>december</i> 

        network of frozen creeks flowing steadily but surely 
        even thru the weary and dark season 
        spell out that everything goes forth
        no matter the weight
        another december has come
        a new year awaits at its end
        i am young
        i am ripe
        cold air and smoke phasing thru my lungs
        as surely as the march of time

        beauty and wamrth awaits
        in my humble home
        haunted by three 
        i am a tree
        roots and all
        standing vigilant and tall
        the winter birds sing their songs
        nested in my hair
        i am alive
        against the odds
        i stand to see another season 
        taller and stronger than ever before 

        come stay warm with me
        spring sunshine beckons us
        so lets plant a velvet seed
        for its bloom will fill our hearts n soul
        with beauty and love
        to last a lifetime

    <pre id="shiver">
        <i>shiver</i>

        a shiver runs down your spine
        the city takes a deep breath
        people moving everywhere
        baking under the sun
        somewhere to the north
        you hear the loss of passion
        in a persons voice
        and everything comes to a halt
        suddenly no one moves
        and the city is holding her breath
        in what feels like an hour
        the moment passes
        and you return to yourself
        in an empty cafe
    </pre>
    <pre id="crow">
        <i>crow</i>

        i want to be free
        as the soaring crow 
        on the horizon.
        flying with friends
        and family alike.

        the sky is a beautiful place
        but i do not know its embrace 
        i know the land
        the soil grass and duff
        concrete and asphalt 

        fallen rocks
        rough edges
        open spaces
        show some care
        for every anchor
        in my body



        id like to be free
        as the zooming swallow.
        zipping here and there-
        caught in the rush of the chase.
        not a care in the world, seemingly 
        only the wind neath their wings
        flipping and turning them
        to n fro.
    </pre>
    <pre id="floating">
        <i>floating</i>

        we are floating
        through the unfathomable ether
        of time and space
        tethered to nothing
        except our minds
        connected by only love

        love with a beauty so powerful 
        even the soft forest breeze
        singing the worlds sweetest duet
        envys to know what strange strength
        lies within our hearts

        its this love alone
        that gives me joy to be a human being
        for our minds that we are so unwilling tethered to
        can be a cruel weight to bear at best
        and a death sentence at worst

        i know each and every day
        a beautiful spring day awaits in my heart
        for me to be warmed underneath is warm, blistering sun
        as the love in my heart will blossom
        while youre there to be my pollinator
        and for this i know
        ill always hold more power than the heat of a thousand suns
        and ill always be more beautiful than every birds song and the wind in the trees
